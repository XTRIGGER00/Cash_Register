## General Info
After an authentication procedure, the user enters the code of a product and the program returns the relative details:
name, brand, weight and price.
At the same time, he saves the code entered as a product purchased by the user in question.

The table of currently available products is below:
```
   code            name              brand           weight   price

   9274106592648   Macheroni         Barilla         500      1.22
   6286127294863   Penne Rigate      Barilla         500      0.89
